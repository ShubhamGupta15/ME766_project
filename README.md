# ME766_project
In this project we are going to implement LBPH algorithm and parallelize it.\n
LBP is the serial code written in C++.\n
LBP_parallel is the above LBP code parallelized using OpenMP.\n\n

To run LBP, type "g++ LBP.cpp" in bash terminal.\n
To run LBP_parallel, type "g++ -fopenmp LBP_parallel.cpp" in bash terminal.\n
