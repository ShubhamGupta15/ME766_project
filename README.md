# ME766_project
In this project we are going to implement LBPH algorithm and parallelize it.<br/>
LBP is the serial code written in C++.<br/>
LBP_parallel is the above LBP code parallelized using OpenMP.<br/><br/>

To run LBP, type "g++ LBP.cpp" in bash terminal.<br/>
To run LBP_parallel, type "g++ -fopenmp LBP_parallel.cpp" in bash terminal.<br/>
